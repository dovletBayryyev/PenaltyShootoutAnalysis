# PenaltyShootoutAnalysis
Analyzing whether shooting first in penalty shootouts gives a team the advantage

## 1. Goal
The goal of this project is to check whether shooting first in a penalty shooutout is advantageous

## 2. Dataset
There are 3 datasets used in this analysis.
1. WorldCupShootout --> This dataset contains all penalty shootouts from all World Cups
2. CopaAmericaShootout --> This dataset contains all penalty shootouts from all Copa Americas
3. EuroShootout --> This dataset contains all penalty shootouts from all Euros 

## 3. Technology 
The technology used here is a python notebook with libraries pandas and matplotlib

## 4. Conclusion
There does not seem to be an advantage of shooting first in a penalty shootout based on the results. However, these findings are based only on World Cup, Copa Am√©rica, and European Championship data. To know whether this truly applies across all competitions, a larger analysis would be required on a much larger dataset of penalty shootouts.
